## Why
The Emails (Master Accounts) tab currently displays a table of emails, but there is no mechanism to add a new email from the UI. Adding an "Add Email" button above the table will provide an entry point for users to initiate the creation of a new master account email.

## What Changes
- Add a new "Add Email" button above the data table in the Emails tab (`src/app/(dashboard)/emails/page.tsx`).

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `email-management`: Covers the UI capabilities for adding and managing emails in the dashboard.

### Modified Capabilities

## Impact
- Modifies `src/app/(dashboard)/emails/page.tsx`
