## 1. UI Updates

- [x] 1.1 Remove the "New Master Account" button markup entirely from `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`.
- [x] 1.2 Remove the `systemMenu` constant array containing "Settings" and "Help Center" links from `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`.
- [x] 1.3 Remove the rendering block for the "System" section (including its `<h3>` header and `<nav>` map rendering) from the JSX return in `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`.

## 2. Review

- [x] 2.1 Verify that the sidebar still renders correctly and doesn't throw rendering errors due to the missing items.
